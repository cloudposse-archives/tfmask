*Example of masking output from a `terraform apply` execution*


## Introduction


If you answer "yes" to any of these questions, then look no further!

* Have you ever wished you could easily filter sensitive output from a `terraform plan` or `terraform apply`?
* Do you use terraform providers that leak sensitive data to `stdout` (e.g. `terraform-github-provider`)?

**Yes?** Great! Then this utility is for you.

The `tfmask` utility will replace the "old value" and the "new value" with the masking character (e.g. `*`).
  
__NOTE__: `tfmask` will preserve the name of the nodes in the graph

## Usage




__NOTE__: The utility supports a number of configuration settings which can be passed via environment variables.

| Environment Variable     | Description                                    | Default    |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------| 
| `TFMASK_CHAR`            | Character used to mask all output              | `*`        |
| `TFMASK_VALUES_REGEX`    | Regular expression used to match values        | [see code] | 
| `TFMASK_RESOURCES_REGEX` | Regular expression used to match resources     | [see code] |

__IMPORTANT__: Pass `-no-color` to `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` for proper parsing

The basic usage looks like this. We're going to run `terraform plan` and filter it through `tfmask`:

```sh
terraform plan -no-color | tfmask
```

### Direnv

You can use `tfmask` with [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/) to set the defaults.

Example `.envrc`:

```sh
# Export terraform environment
export TFMASK_CHAR="#"
export TFMASK_VALUES_REGEX="(?i)^.*(oauth|secret|token|password|key|result).*$"
```

<details>
  <summary>Example of Masked Output</summary>

  ```sh
  Terraform will perform the following actions:

    ~ module.atlantis.module.web_app.module.ecs_codepipeline.aws_codepipeline.source_build_deploy
        stage.0.action.0.configuration.%:          "4" => "5"
        stage.0.action.0.configuration.OAuthToken: "" => "*******************************************"

  Plan: 0 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy.
  ```
</details>




## Examples


### Compiling the Binary

```sh
make go/build
```

 ### Use with Terraform Plan

 Many terraform providers unintentionally leak sensitive information when running `terraform plan`. **This is very bad.**

<details>
  <summary>Example of a Leaked Secret from a Terraform Plan</summary>

  ```sh
  An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
  Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
    ~ update in-place

  Terraform will perform the following actions:

    ~ module.example.aws_codepipeline.source_build_deploy
        stage.0.action.0.configuration.%:          "4" => "5"
        stage.0.action.0.configuration.OAuthToken: "" => "efba05dbe9b94ba18ae3737a6d6de16eefba05dbe9b9"
  Plan: 0 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy.
  ```
  __NOTE:__ This `OAuthToken` is just an example and not a valid token.
</details>


Using `tfmask`, the output from `terraform plan` will be masked like this:

```sh
terraform plan -no-color | tfmask
```

<details>
  <summary>Example of Masked Terraform Plan Output</summary>

  ```
   An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
  Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
    ~ update in-place

  Terraform will perform the following actions:

    ~ module.example.aws_codepipeline.source_build_deploy
        stage.0.action.0.configuration.%:          "4" => "5"
        stage.0.action.0.configuration.OAuthToken: "" => ********************************************"
  Plan: 0 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy.
  ```
</details>

### Use with Terraform Apply

Many terraform providers unintentionally leak sensitive information when running `terraform apply`. **This is very bad.**

<details>
  <summary>Example of a Leaked Secret from a Terraform Apply</summary>

  ```sh
  terraform apply
  module.example.aws_codepipeline.source_build_deploy: Modifying... (ID: example-codepipeline)
    stage.0.action.0.configuration.%:          "4" => "5"
    stage.0.action.0.configuration.OAuthToken: "" => "efba05dbe9b94ba18ae3737a6d6de16eefba05dbe9b9"
  module.example.aws_codepipeline.source_build_deploy: Modifications complete after 1s (ID: example-codepipeline)

  Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 1 changed, 0 destroyed.
  ```

  __NOTE:__ This `OAuthToken` is just an example and not a valid token.
</details>

Using `tfmask`, the output from `terraform apply` will be masked like this:

```sh
terraform apply -no-color | tfmask
```
<details>
  <summary>Example of Masked Terraform Apply Output</summary>

  ```sh
  module.example.aws_codepipeline.source_build_deploy: Modifying... (ID: example-codepipeline)
    stage.0.action.0.configuration.%:          "4" => "5"
    stage.0.action.0.configuration.OAuthToken: "" => "********************************************"                                                 
  module.example.aws_codepipeline.source_build_deploy: Modifications complete after 1s (ID: example-codepipeline)

  Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 1 changed, 0 destroyed.
  ```
</details>
