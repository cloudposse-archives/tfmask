# Short description of this project

  Command line utility to mask sensitive output from a `transform plan` or `terraform apply`.

introduction: |-

  If you answer "yes" to any of these questions, then look no further!

  * Have you ever wished you could easily filter sensitive output from a `terraform plan` or `terraform apply`?
  * Do you use terraform providers that leak sensitive data to `stdout` (e.g. `terraform-github-provider`)?

  **Yes?** Great! Then this utility is for you.

  The `tfmask` utility will replace the "old value" and the "new value" with the masking character (e.g. `*`).
    
  __NOTE__: `tfmask` will preserve the name of the nodes in the graph

# How to use this project
usage: |-

  __NOTE__: The utility supports a number of configuration settings which can be passed via environment variables.

  | Environment Variable     | Description                                    | Default    |
  |--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------| 
  | `TFMASK_CHAR`            | Character used to mask all output              | `*`        |
  | `TFMASK_VALUES_REGEX`    | Regular expression used to match values        | [see code] | 
  | `TFMASK_RESOURCES_REGEX` | Regular expression used to match resources     | [see code] |

  __IMPORTANT__: Pass `-no-color` to `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` for proper parsing
  
  The basic usage looks like this. We're going to run `terraform plan` and filter it through `tfmask`:

  ```sh
  terraform plan -no-color | tfmask
  ```

  ### Direnv

  You can use `tfmask` with [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/) to set the defaults.

  Example `.envrc`:

  ```sh
  # Export terraform environment
  export TFMASK_CHAR="#"
  export TFMASK_VALUES_REGEX="(?i)^.*[^a-zA-Z](oauth|secret|token|password|key|result|id).*$"
  ```

    ```sh
    Terraform will perform the following actions:

      ~ module.atlantis.module.web_app.module.ecs_codepipeline.aws_codepipeline.source_build_deploy
          stage.0.action.0.configuration.%:          "4" => "5"
          stage.0.action.0.configuration.OAuthToken: "" => "*******************************************"

    Plan: 0 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy.
    ```
  </details>

  ### Compiling the Binary

  ```sh
  make go/build
  ```

   ### Use with Terraform Plan

   Many terraform providers unintentionally leak sensitive information when running `terraform plan`. **This is very bad.**

    <summary>Example of a Leaked Secret from a Terraform Plan</summary>

    ```sh
    An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
    Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
      ~ update in-place

    Terraform will perform the following actions:

      ~ module.example.aws_codepipeline.source_build_deploy
          stage.0.action.0.configuration.%:          "4" => "5"
          stage.0.action.0.configuration.OAuthToken: "" => "efba05dbe9b94ba18ae3737a6d6de16eefba05dbe9b9"
    Plan: 0 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy.
    ```
    __NOTE:__ This `OAuthToken` is just an example and not a valid token.

  Using `tfmask`, the output from `terraform plan` will be masked like this:

  ```sh
  terraform plan -no-color | tfmask
  ```

  ### Use with Terraform Apply

  Many terraform providers unintentionally leak sensitive information when running `terraform apply`. **This is very bad.**

  <details>
    <summary>Example of a Leaked Secret from a Terraform Apply</summary>

    ```sh
    terraform apply
    module.example.aws_codepipeline.source_build_deploy: Modifying... (ID: example-codepipeline)
      stage.0.action.0.configuration.%:          "4" => "5"
      stage.0.action.0.configuration.OAuthToken: "" => "efba05dbe9b94ba18ae3737a6d6de16eefba05dbe9b9"
    module.example.aws_codepipeline.source_build_deploy: Modifications complete after 1s (ID: example-codepipeline)

    Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 1 changed, 0 destroyed.
    ```

    __NOTE:__ This `OAuthToken` is just an example and not a valid token.
  </details>

  Using `tfmask`, the output from `terraform apply` will be masked like this:

  ```sh
  terraform apply -no-color | tfmask
  ```
  <details>
    <summary>Example of Masked Terraform Apply Output</summary>

      stage.0.action.0.configuration.OAuthToken: "" => "********************************************"                                                 
    module.example.aws_codepipeline.source_build_deploy: Modifications complete after 1s (ID: example-codepipeline)

    Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 1 changed, 0 destroyed.
